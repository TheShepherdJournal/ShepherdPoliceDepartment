# Will you be prepared?

*Thought from the day....*

The events in Flint yesterday reinforce what many of us say and unfortunately many of us are not willing to accept...there is evil in the world we live in. If you live by the mantra..."it'll never happen here," PLEASE take your head out of the sand and WAKE UP!

Firearms trainer, author and consultant Rob Pincus said it best, "Evil exists. Someday evil will visit you. Will you be prepared?" What does prepared mean? I think it means something different to everyone. I can't tell you what level you should be prepared to, that is totally up to you. I can tell you that even in the perfect situation, it will take the police a few minutes to arrive to a call. That means you need to have a plan of survival for those few potentially life-changing minutes. And to bring everyone back to reality...watching every Ultimate Fighting Championship PPV doesn't make you a good fighter, having a CPL doesn't make you proficient with a handgun and thinking about rainbows and unicorns won't make the evil go away.

I have had conversations with people who think events like this only happen in big cities and could never happen here. While we hope and pray that it never would think about this...Flint is only 91 miles from Shepherd and I personally know a lot of people that fly out of the Flint Airport...the biggest school mass murder didn't happen in the big city, it happened in May 1927 in Bath Township at the elementary school where 38 students and 6 adults lost their lives. In case you are wondering Bath Township is 58 miles straight south of Shepherd.

Consider this...We prepare for the worst and hope for the best...if you follow those 10 simple words, you will not be caught by surprise.

Just something to think about...
